### Games To Make
- Sort Inventory

### Cool Future Ideas
- Particle Effects
- Cheaper Oneshot sounds
- Resource Pack Carrying and IDs.
- Selection Controls (i.e. a game/counter that only appears when on your last strike)
- Ability to control speed levels/max number of strikes
- Prerequiset Games / Session History. (i.e. Add the mentos, Shake the bottle, fly the bottle rocket)
- blend game and review display so that the game is in the background.
- Allow review, count, and speed-up displays to show the next game.
