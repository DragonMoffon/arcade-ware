# ARCADE WARE
A simple warioware-esk engine built in python arcade.

### TODO (sort-of sorted by importance)
- Finish PackManager and Pack loading
- ~~Make duration and remaining time settable~~
- arbitrary scaling
- Boss Games (appears every x games, repeats untill beaten or all lives lost, usually infinite-duration)
- Better control info, not just a name pointer for a texture
- Single Pack Play, Play Order, Endless Mode, Grab-Bag
- Resources inside pack folder for the stinky wasteful people.
- Pooled resources
- Ability to make custom "external only" packs

### Games To Make
- Sort Inventory

### Cool Future Ideas
- Particle Effects
- Cheaper Oneshot sounds
- Resource Pack Carrying and IDs.
- Selection Controls (i.e. a game/counter that only appears when on your last strike)
- Ability to control speed levels/max number of strikes
- Prerequiset Games / Session History. (i.e. Add the mentos, Shake the bottle, fly the bottle rocket)
- Allow review, count, and speed-up displays to show the next game.
