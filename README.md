# ARCADE WARE
A simple warioware-esk engine built in python arcade.

### TODO
- Finish PackManager and Pack loading
- Make duration and remaining time settable
- arbitrary scaling
- Boss Games (appears every x games, repeats untill beaten or all lives lost, usually infinite-duration)
- Pooled resources

### Games To Make
- Sort Inventory

### Cool Future Ideas
- Particle Effects
- Cheaper Oneshot sounds
- Resource Pack Carrying and IDs.
- Selection Controls (i.e. a game/counter that only appears when on your last strike)
- Ability to control speed levels/max number of strikes
- Prerequiset Games / Session History. (i.e. Add the mentos, Shake the bottle, fly the bottle rocket)
- blend game and review display so that the game is in the background.
- Allow review, count, and speed-up displays to show the next game.
